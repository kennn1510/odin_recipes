    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Texas Style Smoked Beef Brisket is a simple, mouth watering recipe. Let's hop in and get to enjoying some of the best briskets you'll ever have in your life.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef brisket meat</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Store your brisket in the refrigerator until you are ready to start trimming. Cold briskets are much easier to work with. Flip your brisket over so the point end is underneath. Remove any silver skin or excess fat from the flat muscle. Trim down the large crescent moon shaped fat section until it is a smooth transition between the point and the flat. Trim and excessive or loose meat and fat from the point. Square the edges and ends of the flat. Flip the brisket over and trim the top fat cap to about 1/4 of an inch thickness across the surface of the brisket.</li>
    </ol>
